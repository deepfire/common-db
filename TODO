* Traps
  - Recognise the fact that hardware traps need different addressing pools, depending on:
    1. whether the different types actually share the same resource pool in hardware, and
    2. whether we need to address them differently, depending on the type, independently of point #1

    This all really stems out of the fact that sometimes we are in exactly opposite situations:
    1. we need same address pool for independently hardware-pooled resources (vector traps and hw breaks)
    2. we need different address pools for resources from same hardware pool (hw breaks and hw watchpoints)
