To use common-db's GDB server you will need a MIPS gdb with XML support.

A proper gdb build thus requires texinfo, flex, bison and expat.

For example, in Debian:

	apt-get install texinfo bison flex libexpat1-dev
        cd gdb
        ./configure --prefix=/usr --target=mips --with-expat
        make
