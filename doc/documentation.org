* About this document

This is the general documentation about /common-db/.

The last version of this document comes along with its source code,
and is also canonically available [[http://www.feelingofgreen.ru/shared/src/common-db/doc/documentation.html][from]]:

    : http://www.feelingofgreen.ru/shared/src/common-db/doc/documentation.html

* What is /common-db/

A programmable debugging substrate, mostly geared to driving target
devices by establishing control via on-chip debugging machinery
through a JTAG (IEEE 1149.1) external port.

On-chip machinery control can be obtained either directly, through a
JTAG adapter dongle, or through a network proxy, talking either the
/TAPCLIENT/ or /RTLJTAG/ protocol.

/Common-db/ itself can serve as a GDB remote target, by exposing its
functionality through the GDB RSP protocol. Alternatively, it can
expose the directly-attached JTAG target through its own /TAPCLIENT/
protocol.

/Common-db/ is designed to be capable to drive targets of different
architecture, although only MIPS32 target is implemented.

Besides being a substrate, /common-db/ includes a number of
component applications, among which it includes:

    - /comdb/, a command-line-driven debugger
    - /comgdbsrv/, a GDB RSP remote target server
    - /flasher/, a flash programming utility

*** Portability

/Common-db/ is written in /Common Lisp/, so in addition to depending
on the host OS, it also depends on the Lisp implementation.

***** Supported host operating systems

|   |             | linux-x86/amd64 | windows-x86 |
|---+-------------+-----------------+-------------|
| / | <>          | <               | >           |
| # | /comdb/     | +               | +           |
| # | /comgdbsrv/ | +               | +           |
| # | /flasher/   | +               | +           |

***** Supported Common Lisp compilers

|   |             | SBCL | Clozure CL | ECL |
|---+-------------+------+------------+-----|
| / | <>          | <    |            | >   |
| # | /comdb/     | +    | +          |     |
| # | /comgdbsrv/ | +    | +          |     |
| # | /flasher/   | +    | +          |     |

* Obtaining /common-db/

/Common-db/ is distributed in source code form, and can be obtained via
its /git/ repository:

    : git clone git://git.feelingofgreen.ru/common-db

However, this won't deal with the myriad of its dependencies, so an
alternative, simpler path is using the /desire/ package management
substrate.

First, ensure that you have SBCL installed, and then issue the
following commands:

    : curl -O http://feelingofgreen.ru/shared/src/desire/climb.sh
    : sh climb.sh -m common-db ~/desr

...which would take a while.

* Reporting bugs

Please, report /common-db/ bugs either by mail, to its author:

    : <_deepfire at feelingofgreen dot ru>

or, via the [[http://feelingofgreen.ru:3000/projects/common-db/issues][bugtracker]]:
